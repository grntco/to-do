# Todoit
This is a project for The Odin Project's JavaScript course to create a to-do list web application.

I used HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS.

In creating this project, I learned and implmented tools and concepts such as Webpack, localStorage (using JSON for the first time), JS modules and classes, and principles of OOP.
